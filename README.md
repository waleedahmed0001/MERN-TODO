# A Simple MERN Todo App

## Overview:
The Simple MERN Todo App is a basic web application built for practice and learning purposes. It represents a minimalistic implementation of a task management system using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project serves as a fundamental example of how these technologies can be combined to create a functional web application.

## Key Features:
User-friendly Interface: The app provides a straightforward and intuitive user interface for managing tasks.

Task Creation: Users can easily create new tasks by entering a title and description.

Task Listing: All created tasks are displayed in a list format, showing their titles and statuses.

Task Status Update: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete, providing a simple way to track task progress.

Task Deletion: Tasks can be deleted individually, allowing users to remove completed or unnecessary tasks.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility.

## Tech Stack:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing task data.

Express.js: A backend framework for building the server and API endpoints.

React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.

Mongoose: A library for simplifying MongoDB interactions in Node.js.

CSS: Simple stylesheets for enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.

## Usage:
Task Creation: To add a new task, simply click the "Add Task" button, enter a title and description, and then click "Submit."

Task Status Update: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete or incomplete. The status will update accordingly.

Task Deletion: To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.

Responsive Design: The app adjusts its layout and design to fit the screen size of the device you're using, whether it's a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

## Getting Started:
To set up and run this Simple MERN Todo App locally for practice:

Clone the GitHub repository or download the source code.

Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.

Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running locally or update the database configuration to use a remote MongoDB instance.

Run the backend server by executing npm run server or node server.js in the project's root directory.

Start the frontend development server with npm start in the "client" directory.

Open your web browser and access the app at http://localhost:3000.

You can now create, manage, and interact with tasks in your local instance of the Simple MERN Todo App.

Please note that this is a simplified and minimalistic example for practice and learning purposes. In a production environment, you would likely want to add more features, error handling, user authentication, and security measures.
